 * Well, I hope you found this fun.

 * A big thank you goes out to Jake Albaugh,

 * Some of the autotyping and syntax highlighting
 * code is based off his work.
 *
 * Fundamentally what happens is, this CSS gets
 * injected into a DOM style tag and written
 * into the pre element simultaneously.

/**
 * ... By the way.
 * You can edit this box.
 * Try adding some new CSS, if you want!
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * The property 'text-shadow' takes the parameters:
 * 'x', 'y', 'blur', 'color'.
 *
 * So if you wanted to mirror the values,
 * you could place a shadow 15px under it,
 * with a little blur for effect:
